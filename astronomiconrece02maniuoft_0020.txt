xvi M. MAN ILII

Λέων ’Τὸροχόοσ, ΙῙαρθένοσ Ἰχθύεσι in comm. Atat. Maass p. 1528 15-7 the same
list is given under the name of ἀντὶζυγα. Concerning the potency of this
aspect there is no dispute: Cens. de (lie nat. 8 10 α septimo zodio, qnod eat
contrarfflm, plenissimus potentissimusque compedum but about its quality
there are two opinions. Firmicus 11 22 2 goes further than Manilius, haec
semper maliana ac minax radiatio est: aud similarly Paul. Alex. D 4 ἀσύμφωνον
τὸ διάμετρον, Ptol. tetr. p. 9¹² , comm. Ptol. p. 33 τὰ . . . διάμετρα . . . μάχησ καὶ
ἐναντιότητόσ ἐστι δηλωτικά, Porph. isag. p. 186, Ceus. frag. 3 8 (schol. German.
Breys. pp. 199 and 223> esrqne maxime aduersum. Hermippus 1 19 on the
other hand says καὶ οἱ κατὰ περιττοὺσ τῶν ἀστέρων σχηματισμοὶ πρὸσ ἀλλήλουσ ἐπι·
ζευγνύμενοι συμπαθεῖσ τέ εἰσι καὶ ὠφέλιμοι, καὶ τούτων μᾶλλον ὁ καθ’ ἑβδομάδα,
ὂσ καὶ κατὰ διάμετρόν ἐστιν, and so also Gemin. 2 5 δοκοῦσιν οῖ κατὰ διάμετρον
’γεννώμενοι συμπάσχειν ἀλλήλοισ καὶ, ὡσ ἂν εἴποι τισ, ἀντικεῖσθαι ἀλλήλοισ.

From the coupling of signs by diameters of the circle one would
now naturally proceed to their coupling by other straight lines.
But this theme is postponed till verse 466: the next business, says
Manilius, is the ascription of the twelve signs to their twelve
tutelary deities. The only imaginable reason why this matter
should be treated at this point, just after the διάμετρα, is that
the gods and goddesses are so arranged in the zodiac as to form
six diametrical pairs.

Each of the twelve signs has onc of the twelve great
gods for its guardian, a system ascribed by Diodorus
11 30 130 the Chaldaeans: τῶν θεῶν δὲ κυρίουο· εἶναι’ φασι δώδεκα

433-452

τὸν ἀριθμὸν, ὧν ἑκάστῳ μῆνα καὶ τῶν δώδεκα λεγομένων ζῳδίων ἓν

προσνέμουσι. The distribution is as follows.

Aries: Minerua. Libra: Volcanus.
Taurus: Venus. Scorpius: Mars.
Gemini: Apollo. Sagittarius: Diana.
Cancer: Mercurius. Capricornus: Vesta.
Leo: Iuppiter. Aquarius: Iuno.
Virgo: Ceres. Pisces: Neptunus.

In the case of Aries Gemini Virgo Libra Scorpius Sagittarius
Aquarius and Pisces, perhaps also of Capricorn, Manilius has so
chosen his words as to suggest the cause which associates the sign

with the god.

The emblema of the same gods are attached to the same signs on the
bas-relies surrouuding the eircular altar of Gabii figure‹l in Visconti’s
Monumenti Gabini, tavola Vin. Aries and the emblems on either side of
him have perished, except the tail of Venns' dove at the feet of Taurus;
but Gemini have Apollo's tripod, Cancer Mercury’s tortoise, Leo Jove’s
eagle, Virgo Ceres’ basket, Libra Vuleau’s pilleus, Scorpius Mars’ wolf,
