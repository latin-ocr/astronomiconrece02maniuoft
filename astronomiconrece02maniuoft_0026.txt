them (687-689) ; and these depend on a matter to which we now
proceed, the dodecatemm'a.

Manilius, treating of this subject, has fallen into a
confusion which deprives of coherent sense a whole
paragraph of his exposition, verses 722-737. That confusion I
have analysed in my notes: here, to explain and perhaps excuse
it, Ι have collected and arranged the various accounts of the
dodecatemory, together with much casual mention which lets us
see how many notions were attached to the name. The materials
are dispersed and fragmentary, and the order and sequence which
I here bestow upon them are conjectura] 3 but this history, true

693-737

or no, will explain the variety of the evidence and harmonise its
discord. I advise no one to read Mr Bouche-Leclercq⁷s account of
the matter, l'astrol. Grecque pp. 299-303, unless he wants to be
confused and misled.

Manil.11 693—712· Each of the 12 zodiaca] signs was divided
Ptol. tetr. p, 1311, 26-35, not only into 30 equal portions called
comm. Ptol. p. 48 ll. 22—7- μοῖραι or partes or degrees, but also, by
9·0·A·G·¹P· 93 '‘md‘’wn another partition, into 12 equal portions
u p· 113 19 sq· called δωδεκατημόρια. Since the degrees
were 30, it followed that each dodecatemory contained 2313*- Each
sign was itself a twelfth part of the zodiac, and often styled
δωδεκατημόριον by astronomerS‚ so that the full title of one of
these subdivisions was δωδεκατημόριον δωδεκατημορίου (Which Scaliger
falsely and absurdly applies to the planetary dodecatemories of
Manil. ΙΙ 7 38—748) 3 but this was generally shortened in use.

ἱ The 12 dodecatemories in each sign were
ἕωῖι· ¹¹ 713-J22'. 9 allotted to the 12 signs in order 3 the first
(3θέ41ΕέΡῆΞίοὲ Ξᾙρῂέεᾳ. to the sign containing it, the second to the

next, and so on to the end. Thus the first
dodecatemory of Aries belonged to Aries itself, the second to Taurus
and the twelfth to Pisces 3 the first of Taurus to Taurus itself, the
second to Gemini and the twelfth to Aries. Let the leader serve
for an example.

 

The row of five planets here figured in the first dodecatemory will be
explained when we come to verses 738-748.
