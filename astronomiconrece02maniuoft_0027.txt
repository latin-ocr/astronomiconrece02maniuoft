ASTRONOMICON ΙΙ xxiii

The importance of the dodecatemories resided chiefly in this:
that a planet⁷s infiuence was supposed to be modified not only by
the signin which it stood but by the sign in whose dodecatemory
it stood. WVhen the Moon stood in the first dodecatemory of Aries,-
the influence of Aries and of no other sign was blent with hers.
But when she stood in his second dedecatemory, then the influence
of Taurus became an ingredient in her effects.

CLCAG· Ῑ Ρ· 93 med„ PP· it was trax-ersing, to ascertain also what
1⁰4 sq' sign was the possessor of the dodecatemory
wherein that degree was situate. The most obvious method was to
count the dodecatemories from the beginning of the sign until the
degree at which the planet stood was reached 3 in other words, to take
the number of the degree, give ἓξ, of that number to the sign itself,
2} to the next sign, and so on till the number failed and, by failing,
announced the possessor of the dodecatemory. For example, let the
Moon be stationed in the 9ῖὴ degree of Aries: it is desired to know
in what sign's dodecatemory that degree is included. Out of 9 give
,Ἓξ to Aries, 22L to Taurus, 2} to Gemini, and there remains but 13:
the number has failed in the sign of Cancer, and to Cancer's dodeca-
temory does the 92¹² degree of Aries belong.

then, in the same order as before, allot 30 instead of ἓξ to each
successive sign. 9 >< 12:108: give 30 to Aries, 30 to Taurus, 30
to Gemini, and there remains but 18: again the number has failed
in Cancer, and to his dodecatemory belongs the 9ωἱ degree of
Aries.

The ‘tertia methodus' (virtually identical with the first) set forth by
Bentley at Manil. 11 736 exists neither, as Bentley states, in Porph. isag.
p. 194 ll. 26-3‘2 nor anywhere else outside Bentley's head. There is nothing
in Porphyry about the number 5 except τοῖο· ε’ ἑξῆσ in 1. 29; and that is a mere
blunder for τοῖσ ἐφεξῆσ. Here Ι may remark that several other of the passages
which I am citing in the margin contain corruptions which upset their arith-

metic3 but they ean easily be corrected by anyone who has a little astrology
and a little Greek.

Thus much, and no more, had the planets to do with the
dodecatemories. It was because the planets were powerful that
