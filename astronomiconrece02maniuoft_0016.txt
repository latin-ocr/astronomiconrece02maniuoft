xii M. MANILII

Three squarcs are similarly inscribed in the circle, and

287’296 form the following tetragons of signs.

1. Aries Cancer Libra Capricornus.
2. Taurus Leo Scorpius Aquarius.
3. Gemini Virgo Sagittarius Pisces.

 

QVADRATA

These three tetragons, of which Manilius speaks at length in
verses 654—672‚ are identical with the τροπικοὶ, the στερεά, and the
δίο-ωμα, which Ι enumerated at 157—196.

Gemin. 2 16 (quoted in my note on verse 290), Firm. 11 22 5.

Now follows a long digression in which readers learning
astrology before they have learnt arithmetic are put on
their guard against a puerile miscalculation. They must not·
suppose that the side of a trigon consists of 5 whole signs 3 for
5 >< 3= 15, and all the signs of the zodiac are only 12. 12÷ 3=4;
therefore 4 signs, or their equivalent, compose the side of a trigon.
The reckoning, in fact, had better not be made by signs, similiter,
ζῳδιακῶσ, but by degrees of the circle, partiliter, μοιρικῶσε these are
360, therefore the side of a trigon contains 120 and no more, and
should be measured, not from sign to sign, but from point to point,
-e.g. from the 15ιιι point of Aries to the 15ὼ of Leo. So also with

297—351
