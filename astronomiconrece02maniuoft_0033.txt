ASTRONOMICON II xxix

Now we come to another and commoner method of divid-
ing the circle z οἳ δώδεκα τόποι, also called ἡ δωδεκάτροποσ,
a division into twelve equal parts like the division of the zodiac into
Signs.

856-967

Since Stephanus’ thesaurus quotes no authority for δωδεκάτροποσ except
Salmasius, 1 note five places where it occurs: Vett. Val. p. 179 11 and 33,
p. 334 4 and 18, O.C.A.G. v iii p. 89 9. It is explained aright by Salmasius
de an. clim. pp. 187 sqq„ but Mr Boll in his sphaera, p. 310 n. 5, confounds
it with the zodiac.

These twelve parts are denominated τόποι by the Greeks and
usually loca by Manilius, who also gives them other names, such as
templa (which I shall use) or sedes or partes. Four of them necessarily
contain the four cardinal points, and the templum is often called by
the name of the cardo. The whole circle of temples is a rigid and
stationary frame through Which the wheel of the zodiac revolves,
so that each temple is occupied by the twelve zodiacal signs in due
succession. The scheme is the following.

 

DVODECIM LOCI

The numeration here given is that of Paulus Alexandrinus, Vettius Valens,
Firmicus, Manetho (1 135, v 278, VI 312, 315), Dorotheus (uu. 112, 161,
223, in C.O.A.G. VI pp. 91 sqq.)‚ Hephaestio Thebanus (ibid.), Antiochus
Atheniensis (C.C.A.G. 1 p. 110 33, p. 111 35), and of astrologers in general:
it starts from the templum containing the horoscopus aud proceeds downward.

Manilius himself assigns no numbers to his templa.
In distributing to these twelve temples their several provinces and
functions there is so much disagreement between Manilius and other
