xiv M. MANILII

 

HEXAGONA

Some astrologers, as 1 said above, ignore the hexagon, and some even of
those who mention it declare it to have little efficacy, as does Manilius
himself and the authors whom 1 cite in the note to verse 358. But, like
the trigon, it is held to be harmonious by Firmicus 11 22 7 heaeayona hoc
idem sunt quod ενίροηα, nisi quod minoris potestatis, Ptol. tetr. p. 9“·, Her-
mipp. 1 19, 0.0.A.G. V111 ii p. 74 18. The scholiast at Paul. Alex. D4
asserts however that this relationship is good only between Gemini and Leo,
between Sagittarius and Aquarius, between Virgo and Scorpius, and between
Pisces and Taurus, that is between signs which see or hear one another,-a
form of intercourse to which we shall come at verse 485. Manilius himself at
11 572 sq. speaks worse of the hexagon: plerumque manent inimica tercia
quaeque Ι lege, in transuersum uultu dqflaea malique.

There might be formed a dodecagon by drawing a straight
line from each sign to its next neighbour, but the efficacy
of this aspect is null. Null also are the relations of signs
divided from one another by four intervening signs, since the line
which joins them is not the side of any equilateral figure which can
be inscribed in the circle. Thus, if a line be drawn from Aries to
Virgo, a line of equal length, 150⁰, can be drawn from Virgo to
Aquarius, but a third line, drawn from Aquarius, must end at Aries,
and will therefore contain only 60⁰, so that the figure formed will
be an isosceles triangle.
