the Moon : from the number of degrees all the thirties (11 it was over

{⁰3³} 5³23,AE 11194 1ὲὲ (in—33 distributcd‚ as far as it would go, through
’ ¹ ¹ γ’ p· . thc signs 01 the zodiac‚ beginning with the
sign in which the Moon stood, at the rate of 2} degrees (5¹3 01 a
sign) apiece. It is the latter part 01 this operation that Manilius,
not knowing what he is about, performs in verses 730-734.

Each sign is further subdivided into more minute parts,
also called dodecatemories, which are allotted not to the
signs but to the planets. In size these pl inetary dodecatemories
are half a degree, that 1s —7—25 01 the circle or ὀῑσ 01 a sign 01· 5of
the dodecatemory described 111 verses 693 sqq. Each 01 those larger
dodecatemories therefore comprises 5 01 these, and these 5 arc
assigned to the 5 planets in order. In what order, Manilius forgets
to say3 but presumably in the usual order 01 the planets‚ which he
himself observes at Ι 807 sq. and V 6 sq: Saturn Jupiter Mars
Venus Mercury. In this order therefore Ι have shown them in the
figure on p. xxii.

Why are these divisions called ὃωόεκατημόριαῖ Because, as each
planet possesses one 01 them in each 01 the larger dodecatemories‚
he possesses 12 011 them in each 01 the signs3 so that one planetary
dodecatemory 1s130f the property possessed 111 a sign by a planet.

These planetar y dodecatemories are found 111 Manilius alone.

The zodiac is divided into four quadrants of 90 degrees
each by 10111· cardines, κέντρα, points. So at least the
astrologers call them, and κέντρα they are in so far as they divide
the ecliptic‚ which is a mathematica] line 3 but since the zodiac is
a band conventionally supposed to be 12 degrees in breadth‚ the
cardines, in so far as they divide the zodiac‚ must be transverse lines
12 degrees long. This however is immaterial : what necds to be re-
membered, and what commentators on Manilius usually forget, is that
the cardines are without magnitude so far as eoncerns the longitudinal
measurement 01 the zodiac, and merely cut it into four quarterS.

The place 01 these four points is fixed as regards the observer,
but perpetually changing as regards the zodiac itself. They are
the points at which the zodiac, revolving with the sky, is at any
moment intersected by the horizon and the meridian, both of which
arc riveted fast to the spectator. To the east 01 him he has the
horoscopus or ortus, to the west the occasus, overhead the medium
caelum, underfoot the imum caelum.
