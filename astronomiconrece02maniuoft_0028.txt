the dodecateinoriea which influenced them, were important3 but
the dodecatemories did not belong to the planets: the very essence
of their character was that they belonged to the 12 signs of the
zodiae.

Ὺ But unfortunater, because the dodeca-

perly meant clodecatemwz'um (signi cuiusuis) in quo chaza constituta est:
the genitive designated not the permanent owner (as in τὸ Ταύρου
δωδεκατημόριον) but the temporary occupant of the dodecatemory.
But the looseness of the phrase left room for a misconception of
its meaning, and its meaning accordingly was miseonceived: the
dodecatemory began to be regarded as the Moon’s property and
no longer as the property of a sign of the zodiac. And to this
inaceuracy, first of speech and then of thought, there was added
another. When the calculation was complete, the result was
announced, not in the correct form, ‘the Moon is in Caneer's
dodecatemory‚’ but thus: ‘the Moon’s

the sign of Cancer. This error would be
encouraged by the circumstance that the word δωδεκατημόριον
signified in astronomy a zodiaeal sign.

But on reflexion it did not seem natural or plausible that the
Moon or any other planet, because it was stationed in a certain
degree of a sign, should become the tenant of a whole sign elsewhere.
It seemed more reasonable that this invisible tenancy should be
restricted to a single degree. Accordingly the calculations, whose
original aim was now misapprehended, were perverted in use.
Their aim was supposed to be the discovery, not of a sign, but of a
