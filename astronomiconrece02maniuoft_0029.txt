certain degree of a sign3 and this degree was supposed to be given
by the exact point at which the multiplied
and distributed number was exhausted. Be-
cause 9 >< 12 = 108 and 108 - 90 = 18, it was supposed that when the
Moon stood in the 9⁶³ degree of Aries her dodecatemory was the
18ι11 degree of Cancer. If the other calculation was employed, in
which 2} without multiplicatiori was distributed to the successive
signs, it now became necessary to multiply
the residue by 12 in order to secure the
same result: 1ss >< 12 = 18.

The notion of a dodecatemory having been thus unrecognisably
distorted and the true purpose of the calculations altogether lost,
men began to enquire why the distribution of the number should
begin at the beginning of the sign in which the planet stood and
not rather at the degree which it actually occupied: that method
seemed much more exact and rational. It was therefore adopted:
if the Moon stood in the 9t¹¹ degree of Aries, the sum given to Aries

was 21 (=30—9) instead of 303 and the
ζῗξῢοῖῐῖἒῖὧὲζέξ Moon's dodecatemory was thus removed 9
degrees further, from the 18ιὶι to the 27ιιι
degree of Cancer. There is a shorter way of securing the same
result: instead of thus adding the multiplicand to the product, add
1 to the multiplier. Multiply by 13 instead of 12, and distribute,
as originally, 30 to each sign: 9 >< 13=117‚

were dodecatemories now ascribed to planets
only: dodecatemories of the four κέντρα or cardines and of the
twelve κλῆροι or sortes are calculated by Paulus in the same
way.

But now, if a dodecatemory is a single degree, why is it called

not 5¹? of anything. Apparently δωδεκατημόριον must mean a μόριον
at which you arrive by operating with the number δώδεκα. If so,
the term need not be restricted to a place discovered by any of the
particular operations described above : any other μόριον can no less
properly receive the name, provided only that the number 12 is
somehow employed in ascertaining it. Hence there was invented
a new sort of ‘dodecatemory of the Moon‚⁷ discovered by a method
similar to the regular method of discovering the κλῆροσ τύχησ. Α
