ever it may be 3 the δίο-ωμα 011 the contrary, as Manilius explains in
verses 176-96, embrace the junction of two seasons and combine the

characters of both.

In citing the prose Greek astrologers‚ who are edited as ill as they

deserve, 1 shall often make tacit corrections. Thus in Paul. Alex. B above Ι

have substituted τηζ for k?-
Jacob p. xxn invents a distinction, unknown to any Roman writer,

between yemim, biformia, and duplicia ; and Mr Bouche-Leclercq, l'astro—
logie Grecque p. 150, quotes Jacob in the belief that he is quoting Manilius.

The three contiguous signs of Taurus Gemini and Cancer
differ from all the rest in that they rise and set hindfore-
most. Because in Gemini the sun is in apogee, his motion is slowest
in this and in the two adjacent signs 3 and this retardation is
fancifully derived by Manilius from the reverse position of the signs

themselves.

Scaliger calls these three ἀποστρεφόμενα and the other nine ὀρθοστάδια, but
Ι have not found those terms in the astrologers or astronomers; the former
would be misleading (since ἀπόστροφα has a very different sense), and the
latter inappropriate. Taurus is described in Vett. Val. p. 6 21 as ἀνατέλλον
ἐκ τῶν ὀπισθίων, and the Latins perpetually call him auersus. Jacob p. XXII
confounds these three signs with the πλάγια or obliquely rising signs, six in
number and contrasted with six ὀρθά, 011 which Manilius touches in 111 275
sqq. ; and this term he translates into Christian Latin as transuorsim orientia.
Mr Bouche-Leclereq on p. 150 again copies him, and on p. 151 taxes Manilius
with J acob’s blunder.

The signs are divided into diurna] and nocturnal on
three different plans. By the first (211—017), which
Manilius prefers, they lie in pairs, and the pairs lie alternately:
Pisces Aries, Cancer Leo, Scorpius Sagittarius, are diurnal, Taurus
