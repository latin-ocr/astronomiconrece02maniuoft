ASTRONOMICON II ix

are at once terrestrial and human, nor of Sagittarius, which is half
human and wholly terrestrial. I have found no astrologer quite
agreeing with Manilius in this division.

C-C.A.G. 1 p. 165 16 χερσαῖα δὲ Κριὸσ Ταΰροσ Δίδυμοι Λέων Παρθένοσ Ζυγὸσ

πάρυγρα); then follows a cross-(livision, ἀμφίβια δὲ Ιζαρκίνοσ καὶ Αἰγόκερωσ
(so v iii p. 97 24). But in Ludw. Maxim. p. 106 6—9, χερσαῖα· Κριὸσ Ταῦροσ
Δίδυμοι Λέων Παρθένοσ Ζυγὸσ Τοξότησ aud ἔνυδρα (κάθυγρα 111 C.C.A.G. V iii
p. 97 25)· Καρκίνοσ Αἰγὸκερωσ ’Τδροχὸοσ Ἰχθύεσ, Sagittarius is transferred to
the χερσαῖα and Scorpius, perhaps by accident, omitted3 then comes a
strange list of ἀμφίβια· Ταῦροσ Καρκίνοσ Σκορπίοσ Τοξότησ. Hephaestio Ι l
gives the epithet χερσαῖον to Aries ‘saurus Leo Scorpius and Sagittarius,
ἔνυδρον to no sign, νηκτόν to Pisces, and ἀμφίβιον to Cancer and Capricornus:
upon the human signs Gemini Libra Virgo and Aquarius 110 confers no title
of this sort. Other lists, as comm. Ptol. p. 67, Vett. Val. Ι 2, C.C.A.G. lv
p. 152 and VII pp. 194-213, are too incomplete and desultor-y to be worth
quoting.

The, term ὑδατῶδεσ, which Scaliger misapplies, does not belong to this

classification but to another, which mayss be found 111 Ludw. Maxim. pp. 105
24-106 2 and C.C.A.G. 1v p. 152 21-3.

234-243 Three signs, Cancer Scorpius Pisces, are fruitfuL like the

prolific creatures from which they take their names.
Three are barren: the Virgin 3 the Lion‚ because the lioness was
thought to¹ bear cubs once only, and Aquarius, for the reasons
suggested in verse 239. The remaining six are neither barren nor
notably fertile.

The Greeks have various names for these quassties, and allot them variously
to the signs The πολύγονα 111 Ludw. Maxim. p. 108 20 and C.C.A.G. 1 p. 166
4 and v iii p. 97 17 are the fecunda of Manilius, Cancer Scorpius Pisces; in
C.O.A.G. V11 pp. 194-211 and Vett. Val. Ι 2 only Cancer and Pisces are so
called, and Scorpius is πολύσπορον or πολύσπερμον instead; in C.C.A.G. vn
p. 212 21 sq. and v iii p. 97 16 all three are πολύσπορα and in Ptol. tetr. p. 49
all three are πολύσπερμα, while in Ludw. Maxim. p. 108 21 and C.C.A.G. 1
p. 166 3 the πολύσπερμα are Aries Taurus Pisces: Hephaestio Ι 1 calls Cancer
and Pisces γόνιμα. sterile is ἄγονον or στεῖρον or στειρῶδεσ, but I find no one
who at once extends and confines any of these terms to the three sterilia of
Manilius, Leo Virgo Aquarius. C.C.A.G. 1 p. 166 5 sq. ἄγονα δὲ καὶ στεῖρα
ταῦτα· Παρθένου· Αἰγόκερωσ ’Τδροχόοσ· λέγεται δὲ καὶ ὁ Λέων διὰ τὸ μονοτοκεΐν.
Ludw. hIaxim. p. 108 23 ἄγονον· Αἰγόκερωσ. στειρώδη· Δίδυμοι Παρθένοσ
Τοξότησ Αἰγόκερωσ. Ι11 Heph. Theb. 1 1 Leo Virgo Sagittarius Capricornus are
στειρώδη ; 111 Ptol. tetr. p. 49 Leo and Virgo are given as examples of στειρώδη,
andin C.C.A.G. V iii p. 97 18 sq. these two are στειρώδη while Taurus Virgo
Capricornus are ἄγονα. Then there are the ὀλιγόγοναι Aries Taurus Leo
