x M. MAN ILII

Aquarius in Ludw. Maxim. p. 108 22, Sagittarius in C.C.A.G. 1 p. 166 5,
Aries Taurus Sagittarius in vn pp. 194-211, Aries Taurus Sagittarius Aquarius
in Vett. Val. 1 2.

There are three running signs, Aries Leo Sagittarius3
three standing, Gemini Virgo Aquarius3 three sitting,
Taurus Libra (which is sometimes shown not as suspended but
as sunk into a heap) Capricornus, three lying, Cancer Scorpius
Pisces. This classification seems peculiar to Manilius.

244-255

The βαδιστικά and ἑρπυστικά, into which the χερσαῖα ἄλογα ἀνήμερα orserae
terrenae are divided in Ptol. tetr. comm. p. 67, are quadrupeds and reptiles,
and the division is one of nature and not of posture. The accusation of Mr
Bouche-Leclercq astr. Grecque p. 151 n. 3 that Manilius ‘confond les signes
qui marchent ou courent, comme le Lion et lc Sagittaire, avec les signes
“lapides'' qui se levent rapidement sur l'liorizon, comme le Belicr‚’ and his
statement that ‘le Belier n’est pas represente courant, mais au repos,' are
false, as may be seen from the Farnese globe or the Bianchini planisphere
or the Leyden Germanicus.

F our signs are maimed : Scorpius, whose claws have been
cut off to form the constellation Libra, Taurus, which
limps and has one leg doubled under it 3 Cancer, which is eyeless 5
and Sagittarius, who is one—eyed.

256—264

Here again Manilius stands alone. The μελοκοπούμενσ, of C.C.A.G. 1 p.
166 9 sq. include indeed Taurus Cancer Scorpius Sagittarius but include also
Aries Leo Capricornus Pisces; the list of Ludw. Maxim. p. 109 3 sq. is Aries
Taurus Leo Libra Scorpius Sagittarius Pisces, of C.C.A.G. v iii p. 97 20 sq.
Aries Taurus Cancer Leo Scorpius Capricornus Pisces3 in vn pp. 194-211
Aries Taurus Leo Capricornus Pisces are so called, in Vett. Val. 1 2 Taurus
and Pisces only. The epithet ὴμιτελέσ, given to Taurus Sagittarius Capri·
cornus, has nothing to do with this matter, and has been noticed at verses
167-172.

Pisces Aries Taurus belong to spring, Gemini Cancer Leo
to summer, Virgo Libra Scorpius to autumn, Sagittarius
Capricornus Aquarius to winter. Such at least is the natural inter-
pretation of Manilius’ words, and it accords with what he has said
in verses 176-196 about the four signs which he here places at the
head of the seasons 3 but most astrologers begin the seasons with
the tropical signs.

Ludw. Maxim. p. 105 19-22 ἐαρινά· Κριὸσ Ταῦροσ Δίδυμοι. θερινά· Καρκίνοσ

In anth. Lat. Ries. 864 (P. L. M. Baehr. v. p. 379) there is a third system:
the vernal signs are Aquarius Pisces Aries, the summer begins with Taurus,
and so on. Hephaestio 1 1 bestows the names of the seasons on the tropical
signs alone.
