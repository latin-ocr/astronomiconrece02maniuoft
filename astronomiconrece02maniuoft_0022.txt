xviii M. MANILII

485 519 The videntia, the audientia, and the amantia et imidiantia.
The videntia are generally called in Greek βλέποντα οι· βλέποντα
ἄλληλα, but also ὁρῶντα. They are defined in Heph. Theb. 11 22 (C.C.A.G.
VI p. 100 11 sq.) βλέποντα δὲ ζῴδια τὰ. ἴσον ἀπέχοντα τῶν τροπικῶν ζῳδίων and
enumerated in Ludw. Maxim. p. 106 10 sq. ὁρῶντα· Δίδυμοι Λέων, Ταῦροσ· nap-
θένοσ, Κριὸσ Ζυγὸσ, Σκορπίοσ Ἰχθύεσ, Τοξότησ ’Τδροχὸοσ, the two tropieal signs
Cancer and Capricorn being exeluded. Statements which entirely, or so far
as they go, agree with the above are to be found in Paul. Alex. D 3, Porph.
isag. p. 193 (where there are misprints both in the Greek and in the Latin
translation), C.C.A.G. 1 p. 155 11-3, Gemin. 2 32. But Ptolemy tetr. pp. 9¹L
sq. and Hephaestio 1 10 put the tropical points for the tropical signs, as Ge-
minus advises in 2 33-9, so that the uidentia will be Gemini and Cancer,
Taurus and Leo, and so forth, with no exclusion of any sign. The chapter
Vett. Val. 1 8, in spite of its title, does not deal with this relation.
The scheme therefore is the following.

 

VIDENTIA

Manilius' MSS deviate from the scheme at 487 sq. Taurum . . . qui . . .
uidet . . . Pisces.

The audiemia are called in Greek ἀκούοντα or ἀκούοντα ἀλλήλων, aud are
divided into κελεύοντα (or προστάσσοντα) and ὑπακούοντα, the northernmost of
each pair commanding and the southernmost obeying. They are defined in
Heph. Theb. 11 22 (C.C.A.G. VI p. 100 8 sqq.), a passage which I have corrected
in the Classical Quartetly 1908 p. 53, ἀκούει δὲ ἀλλήλων τὰ ἴσον ἀπέχοντα τῶν
Ισημερινῶν ζῳδίων (τοῦ ἰσημερινοῦ ζῳδιακοῦ cod.)‚ and are enumerated in Ludw.
Maxim. p. 106 12 sq. ἀκούοντα· Ταῦροσ Ἰχθύεσ, Δίδυμοι ’Τδροχόοσ, Καρκὶνοσ
