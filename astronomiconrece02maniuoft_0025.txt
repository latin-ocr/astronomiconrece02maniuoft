Thus the only wauton attacks are those made by a pair of bestial
signs: by Leo on Scorpius and by Sagittarius on Scorpius and
Pisces. Both assailants are male, and make their assaults on females ,-
which is a contrast to the chivalrous forbearance shown by the same
two beasts and their partner Aries towards their female and human
persecutor Virgo. There are other cases of abstention from hostility
in which law succumbs to choice : Cancer does not attack the
opposite sign Capricorn (which is strange to one who remembers
417-423), while Capricorn, though it attacks Cancer, attacks neither
Scorpius nor Pisces, the signs of Cancer’s trigon, and is attacked by
neither of them; nor is there war between every bestial and every
human sign.

On these enmities Manilius again is our sole informant.

The MSS deviate from the scheme at 542, 543, 545, 552, 553, 555.

The less fertile and attractive topic of friendship is soon
608-640 despatched. Friendship in heaven has no foundation
but geometry, and even that is insecure. Signs of the same trigon
are by courtesy supposed to be on friendly terms 3 but only the
third trigon, Gemini Libra Aquarius, deserves its reputation. In
the first trigon Aries is a good soul and all for a quiet life, but the
violence and fraud of his partners Leo and Sagittarius are now and
again too much for his patience. In the second trigon Taurus has
no true amjty with Capricorn and many quarrels with ‘Virgo 3
Cancer in the fourth too often finds Scorpius a secret enemy and

Pisces a fickle friend. Only from Manilius do we learn these details.

⁵) Still we are not out of the wood. Beside the permanent
643“69“ causes of enmity or friendship between sign and sign
there are temporary causes (645-683) depending on the revolution
of the heaven through that imaginary framework of cardines and
templa which will be erected in verses 788 sqq. Beside the causes
which affect whole signs there are causes affecting only parts of
