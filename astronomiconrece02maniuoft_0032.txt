xxviii M. MAN ILII

ὡροσκοποῦντοσ μεσουρανεῖ μὲν Κριὸσ, δύνει δὲ Αἰγόκερωσ, ὑπὸ ’γῆν δέ ἐστι Ζυγόσ.
Sextus here, with a common negligence of phrase, identifies the κέντρα or
cardine-s with the ζῴδια or signs of the zodiac in which at a given moment
they are contained : similarly Hephaestio 1 1 and others call Cancer ὡροσκόποσ
κόσμου because the 15th degree of Cancer was on the eastern horizon at the
creation of the world, while Paulus A3 says more accurately ἔστι δὲ ἐν τούτῳ
τῷ ζῳδίῳ ὁ τοῦ κόσμου ὡροσκόποσ.

The four cardines are ranged by Manilius in this order of
808-840 dignity: medium caelum, imum caelum, horoscopus, occasus.
To the MC he assigns fame, honours, and success in public life3 to
the IMC wealth and its sources 3 to the Ascendant character, talents,
and the general tenour of life3 130 the Occident the end of life and
of labours, together with marriage, social intercourse, and religion.

The MC is placed first of the cardines not only by Manilius but by Ptolemy
and Firmicus; Hephaestio prefers the horoscopum the opinion of Dorotheus
is doubtful. Further variations of order are given in my note on verse 809,
and no astrologer is in full agreement with Manilius.

The four quadrants or interualla into which the zodiac is
841-855 at any moment divided by these four cardinal points have
severally assigned to them the four periods of human life. To the
superior eastern quadrant belongs infancy, to the superior western
quadrant childhood and youth, to the inferior western quadrant
manhood, and to the inferior eastern quadrant old age.

Paulus ΒΕΖ-3 assigns youth to the first, middle age to the second, old
age to the third, extreme old age and death to the fourth. He calls them
τεταρτημόρια, and Ι find them in no other astrologer3 the term μεσοκέντρια was
apparently invented by Scaliger.

The cardines and interualla together compose the following figme.
