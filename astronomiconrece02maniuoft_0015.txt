ASTRONOMICON II xi

From these classifications of the signs according to their
natures and qualities we pass to their configurations or
aspects, that is their conjunction by certain geometrica] lines or
figures. The most obvious and striking of these local relations,
direct opposition, is postponed till verse 395: the trine and square
and sextile aspects are given precedence, and first among them
comes the prime favourite of astrologers, the trigon.

Geminus adds συζυγία, to which Manilius will come at verse 466.

In the circle of the zodiac there are inscribed four equi-
latera] triangles, in such manner that each angle falls
upon a different sign: the signs are thus grouped in the following
trigons.

273-286

1. Aries Leo Sagittarius.

2. Taurus Virgo Capricornus.
3. Gemini Libra Aquarius.

4. Cancer Scorpius Pisces.
