viii M. MAN ILII

Gemini, Virgo Libra, Capricornus Aquarius, are nocturnal. The
reason of this division he indicates in verses 211-213 by his
arrangement of the names The six diurnal signs constitute the
trigon of Aries (Aries with Leo and Sagittarius) and the trigon
of Cancer (Cancer with Scorpius and Pisces): Aries is the tropical
sign in which the day becomes longer than the night, and Cancer
the tropical sign in which the day is longest. The six nocturnal
signs compose the trigons of Libra and of Capricornus, the signs
of the autumnal equinox and the winter solstice.

There is a trace of this first system in Ludw. Maxim. p. 105 6 sq., ἡμερινὰ-
Κριὸσ Καρκίνοσ Λέων Τοξότησ. νυκτερινοί· Δίδυμοι Ζυγὸσ· Αἰγόκερωσ ’Τδροχόοσ-,
where however Scorpius and Pisces are omitted from the diurnal and Taurus
and Virgo from the nocturnal signs. The four signs thus omitted, I note, are
those immediately adjacent to the equiuoctial signs, aud they were perhaps
called ἑπίκοινα; for the cod, Berol. 173 at C.C.A.G. v11 p. 212 17 has a
defective list which may be completed thus: ἡμερινὰ μέν εἰσι ‘W π §L ‡,
νυκτερινὰ δὲ <Π add. Bon> Δ Ῑό) 227, ἐπίκοινα δὲ <ὅ add. Bon> Υη, “R Β( (ita.
scripsi pro H).

The second system (218-220)‚ by which the six consecutive signs
from the vernal equinox onwards, Aries Taurus Gemini Cancer
Leo Virgo, are diurnal, and the rest, Libra Scorpius Sagittarius
Capricornus Aquarius Pisces, nocturnal, is still more evidently built
upon the same foundation : the diurnal signs are those in which the
day is longer than the night.

C.C.A.G. lv p. 152 18-20 quoted in my note on verse 218.

The third system (221 sq.), which identifies diurnal with mascu-
line and nocturnal with feminine, and so repeats the scheme of
verses 150-154‚ is, like that scheme, Pythagorean and merely

numerical: φῶσ was conceived to be περιττόν aud σκότοσ to be
ἄρτιον (Arist. metaph. Ι 5, p. 986 Bekk.).

In Heph. Theb. 1 1 (pp. 46-67) all is confusion: Leo Virgo Scorpius
Sagittarius Capricornus have the epithet ἡμερινὸν, Aries Cancer Aquarius
Pisces νυκτερινὸν, Taurus Gemini Libra neither.
