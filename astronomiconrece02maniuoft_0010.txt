vi M. MANILII

Three signs, Gemini Virgo Aquarius, are visibly human 3
seven, Aries Taurus Cancer Leo Scorpius Capricornus
Pisces, arc visibly bestial. There remains Libra, which is reckoned
human, as I explain at verse 529, because it is often held by a male
human figure, and Sagittarius, in which both natures are combined.
The bestial are themselves divided into pecudea Aries and Taurus,
and ferae, the five others.

15ΐ-157

157-196 Five of the twelve signs are double: Gemini Virgo Sagit-

tarius Capricornus Pisces. Two of these, Gemini and
Pisces, are complete pairs 3 two are mutilated composites, Sagit-
tarius, half a man upon half a horse, and Capricorn, with a goat's
body and a fish’s tail 3 the fifth, Virgo, is a woman with wings on
her shoulders. The Greek astrologers give the name δίο-ωμα to four
only of these, excluding Capricorn (which they allow to be διφυὲο·
and δίμορφον) for a reason which will presently appear: the dis-
tinction drawn by Manilius in verses 167-172 between Gemini and
Pisces on the one hand and Sagittarius and Capricorn 011 the other
they express by calling the two last ἡμιτελῆ, a name also given to
Taurus because it has no hindquarters. The four δίσωμα (duplicia
Firm. 11 22 8, biformia schol. German. Breys. p. 107 13), Δίδυμοι
Παρθένοσ Τοξότησ Ἰχθύεο-, are equidistant, and compose one of the
three tetragons into which the zodiac, as Manilius explains in 11
287—96 and 654-7 2, is divided 3 they are followed, as he says in
178 sq„ by the tetragon of τροπικὰ, Κριὸο· Καρκίνοο· Ζυγόσ· Αἶγόκερωσ
(that is what becomes of Capricorn), 011 which he expatiates in ΙΙΙ
618-823 and these in their turn are succeeded by the tetragon of
στερεὰ, Ταῦροσ· Λέων Σκορπίοο- “Υδροχόοο·, Which at II 664 he very
improperly calls simplicia, a name to which three of the τροπικά
have equal right: the regular Latin version is solida, Firm. ΙΙ 22 8,
anth. Lat. Ries. 640 2. The four τροπικά mark the decisive advent
of the four seasons3 the στερεοί (of whom Leo is called ἀμετάτρεπτον
and the other three ἀμετάβλητα) preside over months whose weather
is of a settled type, thoroughly spring-like or summer-like or what-
