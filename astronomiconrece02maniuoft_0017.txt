ASTRONOMICON II xiii

tetragons: the side of a tetragon consists not of 4 but of 3 signs,
or of 90 degrees, inasmuch as 12÷4=3 and 360÷4=90. To
Romans, whose slovenly use of their ordinal numbers had already
in Manilius' lifetime thrown the new Julian calendar out of gear,
because the pontifices did not know what Caesar and Sosigenes
meant by quarto qaoque anno, these lessons from the dame-school
were not superfluous· but G1eek leaders receive similar monitions
from the so· -called Porphyly, isag. pp. 186 sq. ὁρᾶν δὲ χρῆ εἰ κατὰ
μοίρασ· ἔχουσι τέλεια τὰ σχήματα και, μη μόιον ζῳδιακῶσ, ὃ μὲν
Γρίγωνθσ σχηματίσμοσ διὰ μοίραῦ· ρκ’, O δε ΤΕΤΡαγωὶΙΟΟ· Οιὰ μοίρασ
0', ὃ δὲ ἑξάγωνοσ· διὰ μοίρασ· ξ’, ὁ δὲ διάμετροσ· διὰ μοίρασ· ρπ’.
πολλάκισ· γὰρ κατὰ μὲν ζῴδιά εἰσιν ἐσχηματισμένοι, κατὰ δὲ μοίραο·
οὐκέτι. Τ116 inordinate length of Manilius’ exposition is perhaps
after all less due to a low estimate of his readers' knowledge of
ciphering than to the pleasure he takes in exercising that eminent
aptitucle for doing sums 111 verse which is the brightest facet of
his genius.

The trine aspect, says Manilius, has much more force
than the quadrate. This statement, which he repeats
by implication in verses 673-680, 15 confirmed by no astrologer
within my knowledge, and by some it is apparently contradicted.

352-357

Thus Firmicus 11 23 says indeed (4) trigyonum . . . maa-ima . . . cum horoscopo
. . societate coniunyi but also says (5) quadratum quoque cam horoscopo . . .
ualidissima radiationis societate coniunsli ; Censorinus de die nat. 8 9 15 equally
impartial, duae visiones τετράγωνοι ει τρίγωνοι perquam efficacem and so is the
author of cens. frag. 3 8 (schol. German. Breys. pp. 199 and 223) aspiciunt
inter se stellae ex quinto siano, qaod dicitur trigsonon, ec habent maximam
consensionem, icem a quarto, qaod dicitur tem-aslonon .. ., et in alterutram
maximnm praestant effectum. The differenee usually made between the
trigon and the teti-agon is a difference not of force but of quality ; the former
is harmonicus or good and the latter discordant or evil: Firm. 11 22 4 and 6,
Paul. Alex. Ε and schol. D 4, Sext. emp. 40, Ptol. tetr. p. 9¹³3 Porph. isag.
p. 186, Hermipp. 1 19, Ο.Ο.Α.(ι’. vm ii p. 74 17-9.

Two hexagons inscribed in the circle connect the alternate

358-384 signs as follows.

1. Aries Gemini Leo Libra Sagittarius Aquarius.
2. Taurus Cancer Virgo Scorpius Capricornus Pisces.

Thus one hexagon consists of the masculine and the other of the
feminine signs.
