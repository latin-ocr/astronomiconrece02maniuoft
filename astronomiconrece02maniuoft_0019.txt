ASTRONOMICON II xv

ἄλληλα, τὰ πρὸσ τήνδε τὴν διάστασιν τὸν ἀριθμὸν εἰληφότα ζῴδια. Heph. Theb.
1 11, Ptol. tetr. p. 10, comm. Ptol. p. 35. Firm. 11 23 7 quae uero loca sunt
ita posita, ut partes eorum nulla uel duplicatione uel triplicatione uel quadru-
plicatione inteyrum CCCLX partium numerum perficiant, nulla cum horoscopo
nec cum alio siquo societatis ratione icmquncur. ac per hoc, quodcumque siquam
extra hunc numerum ficerit inuentum, piqrum ec ableptum dicitur. Cens. de
die nat. 8 6 and 10, Auson. 369 13 sq. and ‘24 sq. The denial of sympathy
to adjacent signs is criticised by Geminus 2 14, καίτοι εὔλογον ἦν ἐκ τῶν μάλιστα
σύνεγγυσ συγκειμένων ζῳδίων συμπάθειαν γίνεσθαι, and Paulus E 3 allows certain
of the ἀσύνδετα to be brought into relationship by what Geminus calls συζυγίαι,
with which we are not here eoncerned. Censorinus too is willing to concede
to neighbouring signs imbecillum conspectum, and Manilius himself in verse 681
says that they preside over the relations of neighbours.

There remains the aspect of direct opposition, which joins
the confronting signs by six lines drawn through the
centre of the circle. This aspect is powerful but, Manilius here
says, discordant no less often than harmonious 3 less often harmoni-

ous than discordant, he says at verse 652. The opposed signs are
these:

395-432

1. Aries and Libra. 4. Cancer and Capricornus.
2. Taurus and Scorpius. 5. Leo and Aquarius.

3. Gemini and Sagittarius. 6. Virgo and Pisces.
