ASTRONOMICON ΙΙ xvii

Sagittarius Diana's hound, Capricorn Vesta’s lamp, Aquarius Juno’s pea-
cock‚ Pisces Neptune’s dolphins. In the two menologia rustica, the Colo-
tianum and the Vallense, mentioned by Scaliger and now shown on pp.
‘280 sq. of O.I.L. 1 i ed. 2, the gods, through an error explained by Mommsen
Roetn. chron. ed. 2 p. 306, have all slipped one place westward, so that
Minerva has Pisces, Venus Aries, and so on throughout the circle. Scattered
traces of the system are found elsewhere, as in Seruius (cited at verse 439)
and in Valens 1 2 ed. Kr. pp. 5-14. The scheme of the planetary houses, so
important in later astrology, is an altogether distinct affair with a very
different origin ; and it is only a fortuitous, coincidence that Taurus is one
of the two houses of the planet Venus, and Scorpius one of the two houses
of the planet Mars.

The gods, by this arrangement, are sorted in couples, males facing females.

Minerua: Volcanus. Mercurius: Vesta.
Venus: Mars. Iuppiter: Iuno.
Apollo: Diana. Ceres: Neptunus.

The same six pairs are sculptured on the triangular pedestal known as the
Ara Borghese‚ Visconti Mon. Gab. tavole A, B, c. Some of the figureS‚
especially Apollo and Vulcan, are mutilated, but all are recognisable.

Still more digression. The signs have dominion severally
over the parts of the human body. Aries rules the head,
Taurus the neck, Gemini the arms, Cancer the breast, Leo the sides
and shoulder-blades, Virgo the helly, Libra the loins, Scorpius the

groin‚ Sagittarius the thighs, Capricornus the knees, Aquarius the
shanks, and Pisces the feet.

453-465

The same list is repeated in IV 'iol-9 and occurs with little variation in
many other astrologers whom Ι enumerate in my note.

Now we return to the geometrical relations of the signs,
from which we were led away at verse 433 3 and we
come to the relation κατὰ συζυγίαν, hy parallel lines drawn across
a diameter of the circle. Manilius himself says nothing to indicate
that geometry is at the bottom of this matter, but swims contentedly
on the sursace amidst the metaphors in vogue. Three συζυγίαι are
treated in the next paragraph, verses 485—519: that to which Ge-
minus isag. 2 27 gives the name, and which unites the signs, usually
called βλέποντα, on either side of the diameter joining the solstitial
signs 3 that which unites the signs, usually called ἀκούοντα, on either
side of the diameter joining the equinoctia] signs, and a third,
peculiar to Manilius, which unites, or rather fails to unite, in sexual
love the masculine and feminine signs on either side of a diameter
drawn from the first point of Taurus to the first point of Scorpius.
The enmity and friendship, odium and foedus, of the signs, mentioned
in verse 469, are expounded later, in verses 520-580 and 608—640:
these are not συζυγίαι, though they are in great measure geometrical.

466—484
