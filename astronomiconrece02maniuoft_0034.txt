xxx M. MAN ILII

astrologers that 1 will not recite it: their agreement, where they do agree,
is mentioned in my notes.

I begin with the four loca principalia, 1, 10, 7, 4, which Manilius
(918—958) places last.

1 <939—94?>‚ containing the horoscopus, is called Stilbon, if I
understand Manilius aright‚ and is conventionally regarded as the
abode of the planet Mercury. It presides over fortuna natorum and
uota parentum.

10 (918-927), containing the MC, is called Fet-tuna and is the
abode of Venus. It presides over marriage.

7 (948-958), containing the occasus, is called Ditis ianua. It
presides over the end of life and also over good saith and constancy.

4 (929-938), containing the IMC, is called Daemonium and is
the abode of Saturn. It presides over the fortunes of fathers and
of old men.

Here let it be noted, for it is commonly neglected or ignored,
that the provinces of these four templa are very different from those
of the four cardines contained in them, which were set forth by
Manilius in verses 808-840.

These four temples compose a tetragon: it will be well to take
next what Manilius (881-917) immediately prefixe5‚ the four other
temples which are geometrically related, by trigon or by hexagon,
to the horoscopus.

11 (881-890), next to the MC on the eastern side, is called
ἀγαθὸσ δαίμων in Greek, which Firmicus renders bonus daemon or
bonus qenins, Manilius otherwise, and is the abode of Jupiter.
Manilius loads it with praises, and forgets in his enthusiasm to tell
us what it presides over.

9 (905-909)‚ next to the MC on the western side, is called Deus
and is the abode of the Sun. It presides over corporum nostrorum
uitia et fortuna.

5 (891-904), next to the IMC on the western side, is called
Daemonie. It presides over health and sickness.

3 (sno-917), next to the IMC on the eastern side, is called Dea
and is the abode of the Moon. Over what it presides the manu-
script text οἱ Manilius leaves us in doubt.

There remain the four temples, treated first (864—880) by
Manilius, which stand in no proper geometrica] relation to the
homswjms, being either adjacent to it or five places away. They

have no special provinces but are all vaguely maleficent.
12 (864-6 and 868-70) next above the lemoscopus.
