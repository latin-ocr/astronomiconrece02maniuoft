ASTRONOMICON II xxxi

8 (871-879) next above the occasus.

6 (871-879) next below the occasus.

2 (866-870) next below the horoscopus.

Of these, 12 and 6 are each described as porta labmis, 8 and 2
are said to be Typhonis sedes.

What is said of the planets in connexion with the twelve temples
has nothing to do with the regular doctrine, not found in Manilius,
of the planetary houses, domus, οἶκοι, which arc signs of the zodiac.
Mercury for example, here placed in* the first temple, has for his
houses the signs of Gemini and Virgo. It will be observed that
Mars, alone among the plancts, has no temple for his abode.
