xx M. MANILII

 

AMANTIA ET INSIDIANTIA

Manilius’ MSS deviate from the scheme at 488 (Tauri) Viryz'ne mens capitur,
498 Centaurus Geminos ec Capricorni diliyz'c astrum (Leo nihil).

Now begins the rehearsal of enmities between the signs,
520-535 already mentioned in verse 469. Of the four trigons,
which Ι enumerated above at 27 3-286, the first, Aries Leo Sagit-
tarius, and the third, Gemini Libra Aquarius, are mutually hostile,
as being not only opposite in place but diverse in nature, the
former bestial and the latter human. This statement I find no-
where but in Manilius.

From the enmities of whole trigons we pass to the
enmities of single signs. These are traced by Manilius
to three sources: geometry (57 2-578), zoology (536-538), and the
freedom of the will (539 sq.). a. A sign is attaeked by the opposite
sign and by the two other members of that opposite sign's trigon.
b. A human sign is attacked by bestia] signs and a bestia] sign by
human. c. There are sallies of pure caprice. Each sign's assailants
may be classified under these three heads as follows.
