ASTRONOMICON II xxvii

Such at least is the fond fancy 01 1116 more innocent astrologers:
that the four cardines are found where the zodiac is intersected by
the horizon and the meridiam, and that they cut the zodiac into four
equal parts. Twice and only twice in the twenty—four hours, 101
611 observer posted outside the tropics, does this dream come true.
Only at the two moments 01 1116 siderea] day when the equinoctia]
points, the 1st of Aries and the 1St 01 Libra, coincide with the
horizon, are the four cco-dines eqnidistant and the zodiac quartered.
At 611 other times the distance 110111 1116 ascendant to the mid-
heaven is greater or less than the distance from the mid-heaven
to the occident, and twice 6 day, when the 6016111161 points 616
011 the horizon, the error, in the latitude 01 Rome at the date of
Manilius, would amount to 25 (legrecS. then for example the 1st
point of Cancer was on the eastern horizon, the meridien cut the
zodiac not at the 1St point 01 Aries but between the 5²¹¹ and 6ἰὴ
degree 01 Pisces, and the cardo thus created, the medinm caelum, was
115 degrees distant from the horoscopus and only 65 from the occasus.

This grave discrepancy between 16166 theory and the practica]
consequences 01 that untoward fact, 1116 obliquity 01 1116 ecliptic, is
recognised by Porphyry isag. pp. 197 sq. and Pancharius C.C.A.G.
VIII ii p. 67, who prescribe means for rectifying the error 3 Geminus
2 20-26 makes blunders as gross 66 those which he corrects (21 Αἰγό-
κερω πρώτηο· μοίραο· δυνούσηο· Κριοῦ πρώτη μοῖρα μεσουρανήο-ει κτλ.);
F irmicus ΙΙ 15 4 vaguely signifies that he is aware of the difficulty.

Another inaccuracy is involved in the use 01 the 1611116 mediwn
caelum and imum caelum. These, in the plain sense 01 1116 words,
should mean the zenith and the nadir, but they actually signify
only the highest and lowest points 01 1116 zodiac, which never mount
to the zenith nor sink to the nadir except between the tropics, and
which in northern latitudes incline so 161 10 1116 south and the north
respectively that some astrologers call the MC southern and the
IMC northern. To 11661 Manilius talk, ‘tertius excelsi signat fastigia
caeli,' ‘ima tenet quartus fundato nobilis orbe,' you would fancy
that the one were sheer overhead and the other plumb undersoot.

Firm. 11 15 1 (quoted in my note), Sext. emp. πρὸσ ἀστρ. 12 sq. οὐ μὴν ἀλλὰ
καὶ πάντων τούτων τὰ ἐπὶ ἑκάστησ ’γενέσεωο- κυριεύοντα ζῴδια πρὸσ τὴν τῶν ἀπο-
τελεσμάτων ἔκβασιν, καὶ ἀφ’ ὧν μάλιστα τὰσ προαγορεύσεισ ποιοῦνται, τέσσαρά
φασιν εἶναι τὸν ἀριθμὸν, ἅπερ κοινῷ μὲν ὀνόματι κέντρα καλοῦσιν, ἰδιαίτερον δὲ τὸ
μὲν ὡροσκόπον, τὸ δὲ μεσουράνημα, τὸ δὲ δῦνον, τὸ δὲ ὑπόγαιον καὶ ἀντι-
μεσουράνημα, ὃ καὶ αὐτὸ μεσουράνημά ἐστιν. ὡροσκόποσ μὲν οὖν ἐστὶν ὅπερ
ἔτυχεν ἀνίσχειν καθ’ ὃν χρόνον ἡ ’γένεσισ συνετελεῖτο, μεσουράνημα δὲ τὸ ἀπ’ ἐκείνου
τέταρτον (measuring upward and westward) ζῴδιον σὺν αὐτῷ ἐκείνῳ, δῦνον δὲ τὸ
διαμετροῦν τῷ μεσουρανήματι· οἶον (ἔσται ’γὰρ σαφὲσ ἐπὶ παραδείγματοσ) Καρκίνου
