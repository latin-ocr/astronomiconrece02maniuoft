ASTRONOMICON II xix

Αἰγόκερωσ, Λέων Τοξότησ, Παρθένοσ Σκορπίοσ (then follows 14—‘20 κελεύοντα καὶ
ὑπακούοντα· Ταῦροσ· κελεύει Ἰχθύσιν, Ἰχθύεσ· ὑπακούουσι Ταύρῳ and so on): the
equinoctial signs Aries and Libra are excluded. similarly Paul. Alex. Ε-Ε 2,
Porph. isag. p. 193 (where again there are misprints), C.O.A.G. 1 p. 155 13 sq. 3
but Ptolemy tetr. p. 9⁰· and Hephaestio 1 9 divide the audiencia, as they
divide the uidentia, by points and not by signs.

The scheme is the following.

 

AVDIENTIA
Manilius‘ Mss deviate from the scheme at 497 Leo cum Geminis . . .
coniunqit . . . aurem, 502 sq. Scorpion . . . ille . . . audit . . . Libram.

The amantia and insidiantia are apparently unknown except to Manilius,
who arranges them as follows. From the point or μεσεμβόλημα between the
first masculine sign Aries and the first feminine sign Taurus there is drawn a
diameter of the circle; and across the wall thus built the masculine signs
play Pyramus to a series oi treacherous or apathetic Thisbes. Each pays
court to that feminine sign which is equidistant with himself from the dividing
point, and. she, if a northern sign, repays him with trickery, if a southern,
with indifference. The scheme therefore is the following.

Aries loves Taurus, who tricks him.
Gemini love Pisces.

Leo loves Capricornus.

Libra loves Scorpius.

Sagittarius loves Virgo, who tricks him.
Aquarius loves Cancer, who trieks him.
