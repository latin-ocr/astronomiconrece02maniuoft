I have lightened the notes on this book, though they still are
heavy, by transferring to a preface my exposition of its astrological
contents‚ together with most of the parallels to be adduced from
other astrologers. The exposition thus becomes continuous, and
the reader may see the wood in spite of the trees.

The signs of the zodiac, counted from Aries, are masculine
and feminine alternately: six masculine, Aries Gemini
Leo Libra Sagittarius Aquarius 3 six feminine, Taurus Cancer Virgo
Scorpius Capricornus Pisces. This division is founded not 011 sex
but on the Pythagorean fantasy that odd numbers are male and
even numbers female. The six masculine signs, so it happens, are
all male creat-ures except Libra, and Libra could be identified with
the Libripens: the feminine are less tractable, for Capricorn has a
great peard under her muffler, and the line is led by a female Bull,
providentially amputated at the shoulders, the softness of whose
nominal sex was imputed either to the Hyades and Pleiades or to
the peculiarity noticed in verse 153.

διὸ ὁ μὲν θῆλυσ ὀνομάζεται, ὁ δέ ἄρρην. Sextus Empiricus puts the cart before
the horse: πρὸσ ἀστρ. ’7 ἀρρενικὰ καὶ θηλυκὰ ἅπερ συνεργὸν ἕχει φύσιν πρὸσ-
ἀρρενοὙονίαν ἢ θηλυγονίαν· Κριὸσ· ’γὰρ ἀρρενικὸν ἐστι ζῴδιον, Ταῦροο· δὲ, φασὶ,

Ptolemy tetr. p. 9 mentions two other systems, in which the sex of the
signs was not fixed, but varied with the position of the horoscope. “
